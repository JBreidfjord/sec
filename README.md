## Project Description
    The main objective of the project is to accurately and efficiently predict whether a patient has or is likely to have
    diabetes. With data on various factors that contribute to diabetes, a logistic regression algorithm can be used to predict the diabetes outcome. The algorithm will use logistic regression to produce accurate results on whether the patient is likely to have or get diabetes. This data will be visualised to showcase the probabilities of having diabetes.

# Our approach
    Firstly, the data is unpacked from the .csv file and stored in a panda DataFrame. This DataFrame is used to create a logistic function that can take in training data and outputs a model. The training data comes from all data recieved that contains a recorded diagnosis of a patient. The rest of the data is then stored as unprocessed data that can be passed through the function returning predictions about a patient's likelihood of having diabeities.  
    This data will be visualized with a table.
